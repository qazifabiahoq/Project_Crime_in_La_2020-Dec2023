# Project_Crime
Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze crime trends in Los Angeles, addressing key questions related to crime distribution by area and monthly variations over the years. The analysis utilizes Python and popular data analysis libraries, such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, to visualize and interpret the data.

2 questions were answered by me: 

•What areas have a significantly high crime rate?

•Is crime increased during certain months in a year?

Project Structure:

Question 1 (Crime distribution by area):
Visualization 1:
Description: Bar plot displaying total crime counts for each area.
Code: Utilizes matplotlib to create a bar plot.
Findings: Highlights the areas with the highest and lowest crime counts, providing a quick overview of crime distribution.
Statistical Test:
Description: Performs a t-test to compare crime counts between different areas.
Code: Statistical test not explicitly included in the provided code.
Findings: Identifies significant differences, if any, in crime counts between areas.

Question 2 (Monthly crime trends over the years):
Visualization 2:
Description: Line plot illustrating crime trends for each area over the years.
Code: Utilizes matplotlib to create a line plot.
Findings: Reveals trends in crime counts for the top 7 areas, emphasizing the need for adaptive law enforcement strategies.
Visualization 3:
Description: Line plot showing total monthly crime counts.
Code: Utilizes matplotlib to create a line plot.
Findings: Depicts overall monthly crime trends over the entire period, highlighting potential fluctuations and patterns.
Visualization 4:
Description: Scatter plot with a linear regression line for the correlation between the month and total crime count.
Code: Utilizes matplotlib and scipy.stats.linregress.
Findings: Explores the linear relationship between the month and total crime count, providing insights into long-term trends.
Findings Summary:
1. Monthly Crime Trends Over the Years (Top 7 Areas):
General Trend: Identifies a surge in crime rates in 2021, followed by a decline.
Overall Crime Magnitude: Emphasizes the varying crime magnitudes across areas, necessitating tailored resource allocation.
Temporal Patterns: Highlights peak periods and subsequent declines, guiding resource allocation and intervention planning.
2. Exploring Monthly Crime Trends Over the Years:
2020 Trends: Indicates fluctuations, suggesting external influences on criminal activity.
2021 Surge: Recognizes a significant increase in crime rates followed by a dynamic response.
Temporal Patterns: Emphasizes the importance of adaptability in short-term intervention strategies.
3. Unveiling Trends Over Time (Linear Regression):
Linear Regression Equation: Indicates a decreasing trend in crime counts over time.
Statistical Significance: Cautions about interpretation due to a non-significant p-value, suggesting the need to consider external factors.
Correlation Coefficient (r): Highlights the importance of a higher correlation coefficient for a more robust relationship.

Practical Implications:
Resource Allocation: Guides law enforcement in targeted resource allocation during periods of expected decrease.
Temporal Dynamics: Recognizes the importance of understanding temporal patterns for adaptive law enforcement strategies.
Complex Influences: Acknowledges the multifaceted factors influencing crime rates, emphasizing a holistic approach in law enforcement strategies.

Views and Thoughts:
External Factors: Acknowledges potential influences such as the impact of COVID-19, economic conditions, and social policies on crime dynamics.
Need for Further Investigation: Calls for comprehensive studies to identify specific causative factors for more targeted and effective law enforcement strategies.

This README provides an overview of the project structure, code snippets, findings, and practical implications. Further details on statistical tests and external factors influencing crime trends are included for a comprehensive understanding. For additional insights, detailed statistical analyses and further investigation into external factors are recommended.
